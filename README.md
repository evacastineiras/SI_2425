This project implements a multi-agent system using the Jason platform (AgentSpeak) to coordinate two autonomous domestic robots. The robots are designed to operate in a home environment, ensuring timely delivery of medication to the owner while managing real-world constraints such as:

- Time-sensitive delivery: Robots deliver medication exactly when needed.

- Stock and expiration management: Continuous monitoring of medication inventory and expiration dates.

- Energy-awareness: Agents track their own battery levels and autonomously schedule charging cycles.

- Owner behavior modeling: Robots adapt to the ownerâ€™s behavior patterns and routine to optimize interactions.

This project is implemented using a clear Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure for maintainability and scalability and showcases complex coordination strategies, event handling, and proactive/reactive behavior in dynamic environments, demonstrating the power of BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) agents in realistic domestic scenarios.
